# code-javascript-quiz

## Description

The JavaScript code quiz is intended to help students to test their knowledge and keep track of their score. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. 
This app is a multiple-choice questions quiz with a timer of 75 seconds and a penalty of minus 10 seconds for each wrong answer.
Audio feedback is implemented based on whether the user's answer is correct or wrong.
The quiz ends when all questions are answered or when the timer reaches 0, ensuring that users complete the quiz within the allotted time. Upon completion of the quiz, the user's score is displayed, allowing them to see their performance.
All scores are saved in local storage, allowing users to view their scores even after refreshing the page or closing the browser. The highscores page displays all scores from highest to lowest, providing a leaderboard-style view of scores.
Users have the option to clear local storage and the list of scores by clicking on the 'Clear Highscores' button.
